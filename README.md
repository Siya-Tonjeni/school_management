### Question 10

#### Sonwabile Gxoyiya -

For the Name Entity if there was a need to add a field or change the field type it means the data needs to be changed in the two classes Employee and Student.


#### Siyamtanda Tonjeni - Address
The address entity would have been better if it was embedded for a slightly better performance. This would create less storage and its a guarante that you will never have multiple addresses for a single user. 


#### Hlombekazi Mbelu -


#### Zintle Zothe -


#### Nikiwe Mkontshwana -
 Security to be added so that the code may not be vulnerable


#### Abongile Tshopi -
